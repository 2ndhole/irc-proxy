The App object, in proxy.rb, glues everything together.  When the
program starts, it creates a ServerConnection object for every server
in config.yml, and a Listener object, which listens on a TCP port for
clients and creates a ClientConnection object when a client connects.

Each ServerConnection object connects to a server and joins the
channels specified in config.yml.  When a channel or private message
is received, it passes it back to App#handle_privmsg or
App#handle_chanmsg, which passes it to the appropriate
ClientConnection.

Each ClientConnection object handles a client.  When a client tries to
send a channel or private message, it passes it back to
App#send_privmsg or App#send_chanmsg, which passes it to the
appropriate ServerConnection.
