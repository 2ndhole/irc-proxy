- Prefix channels and users with something to indicate the server.

- Buffer conversations into a file when clients are not connected, and replay them when a client connects.

- Change server nick when clients disconnect.

- Get rid of threading and write a single dispatcher which calls IO.select and passes events back to AsyncSocket classes.  (Is this what EventMachine does?)
