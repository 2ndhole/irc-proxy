- Hook up sqlite

- Ignore JOIN messages from clients, but force-join clients to all known server channels upon connection.

- Play back buffered conversations when a client connects.

- Prefix channels and users with something to indicate the server.

- Change server nick when clients disconnect.

- Get rid of threading and write a single dispatcher which calls IO.select and passes events back to AsyncSocket classes.  (Is this what EventMachine does?)
